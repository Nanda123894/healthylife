					<p>Eat a good diet
The secret to longevity depends a great deal on what we eat. To maintain good health and live as long as possible, you should:

Eat a largely plant-based diet
Consume plenty of whole grains, nuts and legumes
Limit your calorie intake to a moderate (not excessive) level and avoid overeating
Avoid consuming alcohol in excess but stick to moderate levels of wine consumption
Avoid too much protein
Avoid excessive sugar and saturated fat
Confine your food consumption to a 12-hour period in the day (such as between 7.30am and7.30pm, for instance)
Drink coffee and tea
The impact of food on our health is well-documented, and eating the right kind of diet (and largely avoiding the wrong kind of foods) will go a long way towards reducing your risk of premature death and certain diseases.
					Get enough sleep
Regularly getting enough sleep also has an influence on longevity, with both too much sleep and too little considered to be harmful. Getting less than 5 – 7 hours of shut-eye a night is linked to a greater risk of early death, and surprisingly, so is sleeping more than 8 – 9 hours per night. Too little sleep has been linked to inflammation, obesity and a higher risk of disease, while too much sleep has been linked to depression, low levels of physical activity and certain health conditions. Maintaining a regular routine of 7 – 8 hours of sleep per night, and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, will positively impact your lifespan.
					Maintain good mental health
The mind-body connection cannot be ignored when it comes to living longer, and a healthy mind leads to a healthy body. If you want to live for longer, avoid stress as much as possible, and retain a strong sense of purpose into old age. Anxiety and stress may decrease your lifespan significantly, with those suffering from stress being up to two times more likely to die from a disease such as stroke or heart disease. And having a purpose in life helps maintain essential brain activity and increases feelings of self-worth and value – both important for good health.</a></p>
